echo "📋 CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED:"
echo "- ✅ Readiness probe: Changed from '/' to '/test-simple' (database-independent)"
echo "- ✅ Liveness probe: Changed from '/' to '/health' (basic health check)"
echo "- ✅ Added proper timeouts and failure thresholds"
echo "- ✅ Reduced initial delays for faster startup detection"

echo ""
echo "🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "1. Build pipeline should complete normally (~2-3 minutes)"
echo "2. Deployment should NOT get stuck in 'Checking OKE deployment status' loop"
echo "3. Pods should become ready within 1-2 minutes after deployment"
echo "4. LoadBalancer IP should be assigned within 5 minutes total"

echo "🔍 MONITORING CHECKLIST:"

cat << 'EOF'

Monitor in Oracle Cloud Console → DevOps:

✅ Build Pipeline Status:
   - Should show "SUCCEEDED" in ~2-3 minutes
   - Container image should be pushed to OCIR

✅ Deployment Pipeline Status:
   - Should show progress through each step
   - "Create Database Wallet Secret" step should complete
   - "Deploy to OKE" step should NOT hang on status checking
   - Should complete in 5-8 minutes (not 8+ minute timeout)

✅ Kubernetes Pod Health:
   - Pods should transition: Pending → Running → Ready
   - Readiness checks should pass quickly with /test-simple endpoint
   - No repeated probe failures in logs

✅ Load Balancer Assignment:
   - External IP should be assigned
   - Service should be accessible on port 80

echo "🚨 WHAT TO WATCH FOR:"
echo "❌ If deployment still hangs → Check pod logs for probe failures"  
echo "❌ If /test-simple returns 500 → Backend startup issue (separate from probes)"
echo "❌ If /health returns 500 → Application health issue"
echo "✅ If deployment completes quickly → Probe fix successful!"

echo "⏱️  TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS:"
echo "0-2 min:  Build pipeline running"
echo "2-3 min:  Build complete, deployment starts"
echo "3-5 min:  Wallet secret creation, manifest deployment"
echo "5-8 min:  Pod startup, probe success, deployment complete"
echo ""
echo "🆚 Previous Failed Deployment: Got stuck at 5+ minutes in status loop"
echo "🎯 Target: Complete deployment in under 8 minutes"

echo ""
echo "📱 NEXT STEPS AFTER SUCCESS:"
echo "1. Get the new LoadBalancer IP"
echo "2. Test frontend visibility: http://[IP]/ should show React app"
echo "3. Test login endpoint: Should return 200/302 (not 500)"
echo "4. Verify complete end-to-end functionality"

echo ""
echo "💡 TIP: The key difference is the probes now hit lightweight endpoints"
echo "   that don't require database connectivity for pod readiness detection."
